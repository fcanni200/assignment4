                <h2>Hometown Hammonton, NJ</h2>
                <p>My name is Franco Cannistra, I was born and raised in Hammonton, NJ. Currently still living in town with my Mom, Dad, Sister and Grandmother. Hammonton is a very small Italian town located  between Phialdelphia and Atlantic City, which is perfect for a small Italian Family. Two little facts about Hammonton are, we have the longest running Italian festival in the country and also are known as the "Blueberry Capitol of thr World." </p>

                        <h2>Career</h2>
                        <p>I started my early career working on my cousins Blueberry farm. I was in charge of deliviering the box trucks full of blueberries to the packing house where they would be shipped all across the country. I did this every summer until I graduated High School. After I graduated I started working at my old High School as a maintenance man. Since they knew I had gone to college for computers they also used me in their IT department. In 2016 I applied for a Technican job with Comcast. I am still working with the company and curretnly training to become a Software Engineer with the company.</p>

                        <h2>Places I've Visited</h2>
                        <p>There are many places that I have been to growing up. Some of which include Bush Gardens in Virgina, Disney World in both California and Florida, Miane, Ohio, and Vermont. Two of my most favorite trips that I have been on is my trip to Aspen Colorado, and Italy. I spent one week in Aspen for a ski trip with a few friends. That was the best trip we have ever been on. The skiing out west compared to the east coast are like night and day. My trip to Italy was a good one as well. I went with my family to visit the rest of our family that still lives there. While we were there we visited Rome, Venice and spent the rest of the time in Sicily. Majority of my family lives in a town called Monforte San Giorgio where we spent a month staying at. It was a really awesome experience. </p>
