                <h2>Hometown Hammonton, NJ</h2>
                <p>My name is Franco Cannistra, I was born and raised in Hammonton, NJ. Currently still living in town with my Mom, Dad, Sister and Grandmother. Hammonton is a very small Italian town located  between Phialdelphia and Atlantic City, which is perfect for a small Italian Family. Two little facts about Hammonton are, we have the longest running Italian festival in the country and also are known as the "Blueberry Capitol of thr World." </p>

                        <h2>Career</h2>
                        <p>I started my early career working on my cousins Blueberry farm. I was in charge of deliviering the box trucks full of blueberries to the packing house where they would be shipped all across the country. I did this every summer until I graduated High School. After I graduated I started working at my old High School as a maintenance man. Since they knew I had gone to college for computers they also used me in their IT department. In 2016 I applied for a Technican job with Comcast. I am still working with the company and curretnly training to become a Software Engineer with the company.</p>
